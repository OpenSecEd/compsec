# Teaching and tutoring

Interactive sessions will use [Zoom](https://miun-se.zoom.us), in particular 
the [this room](https://miun-se.zoom.us/my/dbosk).

There are clients for the web browser (no installation), the computer (Linux, 
Mac, Windows) and smartphones (Android, iPhone).


# Asynchronous communication

The best way to get questions answered in the course is to post them in the 
(relevant) forum. Then any teacher can answer and other students can see that 
their question has already been asked and answered.


# Times and schedule

All scheduled events for this course will be scheduled using the University's 
central scheduling system.  That means all events should be visible to you in 
your [personal schedule in the Student 
Portal](https://portal.miun.se/web/student/schedule) and be able to export them 
to the calendar app of your choice.
