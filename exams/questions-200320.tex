\section*{The assignment}

You should design the architecture for an online banking app.
This means the design of the app internals and the server-side API\@.

The app should provide the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create an account.
    For money-laundering purposes, the account must be tied to a real identity.

  \item See the account balance and transaction history.
    Only the account holder should be able to do this.

  \item Transfer money from one account to another.

  \item Anonymous payments (think Swish, but better).
    The money should be untraceable:
    the recipient will not learn who paid (\eg the account),
    the bank will not learn who paid to whom (\eg from which account to which 
    account),
    the sender will not learn the account of the recipient.
\end{enumerate}

You can see the last one as optional for a higher grade than E.

Solving this assignment will touch upon almost every topic in the course.
Make sure to base your designs on the theory of the course, add references, 
that will help you (remember that's a part of the grading criteria).
\enquote{This feels secure} is not a convincing argument.
Likewise, \enquote{all connections should use TLS} will not cut it either; why 
do you want TLS, what properties do you need and which of those will TLS 
provide and why?
