\section{Scope and aims}%
\label{sec:aim}

\mode<presentation>{%
  \subsection{Scope}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item The course treats a wide interpretation of Information Security.
      \item It treats both engineering and management.

        \pause

      \item The first part is about management.
      \item The second part is about engineering.

        \pause

      \item But the principles from the engineering parts can be applied in an 
        organization's process design too.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

The course treats information security from a user, organization and technical 
perspective.
The first part of the course concerns security on a strategic level, \ie 
managing security within an organization.
The second part of the course focuses on the operative parts, \ie security 
mechanisms and principles for design of secure systems.
In full, the course aims at giving you an understanding of threats to security 
and how to work to protect against these.

\mode<presentation>{%
  \subsection{Aims}
}

More concretely, the \acp{ILO} of the course are the following.
After completing the course, you should be able to:
\begin{frame}
\mode<presentation>{You should be able to}
\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{apply} basic concepts and models in information security.

    \pause

  \item \emph{evaluate} the usability of security solutions and \emph{suggest} 
    improvements that improve usability and security.

  \item \emph{analyse} threats, possible protection mechanisms and \emph{design} 
    an approach to protection which considers usability.

    \pause

  \item \emph{apply} the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency's Framework for 
    Information Security Management Systems to \emph{analyse, assess and 
      improve} the information security in an organization.

    \pause

  \item \emph{review and apply} the results of published research in the 
    security field.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
The course has a variety of learning sessions designed to ensure that you learn 
these \acp{ILO}.
Each such session has a set of further specified \acp{ILO}:
\eg the first outcome above refers to \enquote{basic concepts and models}, 
the \acp{ILO} of a learning session would specify which concepts and models it 
covers.


\section{Course structure and content overview}%
\label{sec:outline}

The first part of the course covers information security on a strategic level, 
this concerns organizational management systems for information security: how 
to implement these and how to continuously run them in an organization.
The main material used for this part~\cite{%
  MSB2011itm,MSB2011sle,MSB2011p,%
	MSB2011v,MSB2011r,MSB2011gap,MSB2011gb,%
	MSB2011vs,MSB2011us,MSB2011upo,%
	MSB2011pg,MSB2011koa,MSB2011i,%
	MSB2011o,MSB2011g,MSB2011lg,%
	MSB2011ulo,MSB2011kf,MSB2011fa%
} is produced by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and is based on 
the ISO 27000 standard documents.

The second part of the course will focus on the content of Anderson's book 
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and Gollmann's book 
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
The focus in the second part of the course is on security mechanisms and how to 
use these in secure systems.
There is also some additional material for this part of the course, \eg 
research papers and some other material.

\subsection{Teaching and tutoring}

\mode<presentation>{%
  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Teaching consists of several types of learning sessions.
      \item Most topics are covered only by lectures.
        
        \pause

      \item Some are complemented with seminars, hand-ins and labs.
      \item These are for combined learning and assessment.

        \pause

      \item These are focused to the first six weeks.
      \item The last four weeks are dedicated to the project.
      \item These weeks have weekly tutoring sessions.
        
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

The course is taught using lectures, seminars, laboratory assignments and, 
finally, a project.
All assignments are numbered consecutively prefixed with an \enquote{L} for 
laboratory assignments, \enquote{S} for seminar assignments, \enquote{M} for 
memos and \enquote{P} for projects.

\subsection{Schedule}

You will find an outline for a schedule for the course in \cref{Schedule}.
You are free to follow this schedule or any schedule you make for yourself, but 
the learning and tutoring sessions, deadlines etc.\ will follow this schedule.
The detailed reading instructions for each item in the schedule can be found in 
the following sections.

During this lecture we will shortly review the course and try to fit things into 
a bigger picture.

\subsection{P7 A short study in information security}

\mode<presentation>{%
  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Small independent study in information security.
      \item Aim is to practice your knowledge from the course.
      \item As well as deepen your knowledge in some parts.

        \pause

      \item And to assess that you reach the \acp{ILO} above.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item You are quite free in choosing.
      \item But the project must be connected to research.
      \item You must select and read relevant research papers.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

The project is a smaller study within the area of information security.
The idea is to deepen your knowledge in some areas of information security, so 
during the project you must select and read papers which are related to the 
course.
For example, you can focus on areas such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item usable security,
  \item privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), or
  \item more advanced methods for guessing passwords.
\end{itemize}
These are just examples, you are free to choose the area and papers in 
corroboration with the tutor.
More details are provided in the separate instruction.

\Cref{LADOKTable} visualizes the relations between modules, credits, grades and 
LADOK\@.

    P means pass, F means fail.
    A--E are also passing grades, where A is the best.
  }\label{LADOKTable}
\end{table}
\end{frame}

The project is graded from A to F, where A--E are for passing and F and Fx are 
for failing.
The grade of the project will also be the grade of the course total.
