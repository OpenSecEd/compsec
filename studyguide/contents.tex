  \subsection{Scope}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item We treat computer security.
      \item \Ie how to secure computer systems.

        \pause

      \item We cover authentication and access control, software security, 
        \etc.

        \pause

      \item This gives a good foundation that can later be expanded with things 
        like network security and information security.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

This course is an introduction to computer security.
The course aims towards a good understanding for the requirements of a secure 
computer system.
Problems such as authentication and access control; software security, such as 
buffer overflows; as well as operating system, library and application security 
mechanisms are treated in the course.

More concretely, the \acp{ILO} of the course are the following.

\section{Course structure and content overview}%
\label{sec:outline}

% - Basic cryptography: block ciphers, asymmetric cryptosystems, digital 
%   signatures, hash functions.
% - User authentication, access control and intrusion detection.
% - Software security: buffer overflow, handling input, interaction between 
%   programs.
% - Operating system security.
% - Malware.
% - Trusted computing, hardware based security and whole disk encryption.
% - Ethical aspects of computer security.

The course covers
applied cryptography used in computer security, \eg uses of cryptography for 
code obfuscation or digital rights management;
authentication mechanisms, access control, and intrusion detection;
software security, \eg buffer overruns and interaction between programs;
some security mechanisms provided by operating system and hardware;
and malicious software and how these utilise weaknesses in the system.
Finally, we discuss some ethical implications for computer engineers.

\subsection{Teaching and tutoring}

\mode<presentation>{%
  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item The course takes a bit of flipped-classroom approach.
      \item This means that the bulk of lectures will be recorded.
      \item Then we'll be more interactive in the classroom.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item We'll use ScalableLearning for the recorded material.
      \item This allows you to comment during the video.
      \item There might also be some quizzes to answer during the video.

        \pause

      \item I'll use the results from these to prepare for the classroom.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Some sessions are seminars.
      \item You must prepare for these, there are instructions.
      \item Vary from reading papers to do some lab work.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

The course takes a flipped-classroom approach.
This means that there will be pre-recorded lectures and the classroom time will 
be spent where it is needed the most.
The videos are available through ScalableLearning.
There you can post questions related to the content during the video, you might
answer quizzes in the video \etc.
These questions and the results to any quizzes will be available to the teacher 
and the teacher will review these before the classroom session.
After reviewing any difficulties, the classroom time will be spent working with 
the material.

Some sessions are mandatory.
The sessions for seminars are mandatory, you will see this in the assignment 
instructions.
All assignments are numbered consecutively prefixed with an \enquote{L} for 
laboratory assignments, \enquote{S} for seminar assignments.

\subsection{Schedule}

You will find an outline for a schedule for the course in \cref{Schedule}.
You are free to follow this schedule or any schedule you make for yourself, but 
the learning and tutoring sessions, deadlines \etc will follow this schedule.
The detailed reading instructions for each item in the schedule can be found in 
the following sections.

\section<article>{Course content}

This section summarizes the material covered by the lectures and assignments, 
\ie what you should read for each of them.
It is divided by topics and ordered according to progression of the course, 
\cref{Schedule} gives an overview along with a schedule.

\subsection{Course conclusion}\label{conclusion}

During this lecture we will shortly review the course and try to fit things 
into a bigger picture.
This is also a chance for revision and final questions before the exam.

\subsection{Final exam}

The final exam will assess how well you have achieved the intended learning 
outcomes of the course.
Hence, it covers all the content given above.

Each question on the exam covers one topic of the course.
To pass the exam (and thus the course) you must pass all questions (thus all 
topics), \ie \emph{you must not receive zero on any question}.
If you receive a \emph{zero on one question} you qualify for complementing that 
zero orally during a meeting.

  \subsection{LADOK modules}
}

This section explains how the course modules are graded and mapped to LADOK\@.
\Cref{LADOKTable} visualizes the relations between modules, credits, grades and 
LADOK\@.

\begin{frame}
  \input{ladok.tex}
\end{frame}

The written exam will be graded A--E for passing grades, F or Fx for failing 
grades.
You will receive an Fx if you are very close to passing.
In this case you may complement your written exam with an oral exam.
If you do not take this chance you must retake the exam the next 
time it is given.
The grade of the exam will also be the grade of the course total.
