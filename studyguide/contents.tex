\section{Scope and aims}
\label{sec:aim}
The course aims towards a good understanding for the requirements of a secure 
computer system.
Problems such as authentication and access control; software security, such as 
buffer overflows; as well as operating system, library and application security 
mechanisms are treated in the course.

More specifically, after taking this course you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item apply different cryptosystems and explain how these work,
  \item analyse the problems of authentication, access control and different 
  solutions,
  \item explain how some common attacks on software works,
  \item analyse different operating system security mechanisms,
  \item analyse the functionality of different types of malware,
  \item explain different malware protection mechanisms,
  \item evaluate strengths and weaknesses of hardware-based security and 
    full-disk encryption, as well as
  \item value and argue about different ethical aspects of computer security, 
    e.g.\ surveillance.
\end{itemize}


\section{Overview of structure and content}
\label{CourseOutline}
% - Basic cryptography: block ciphers, asymmetric cryptosystems, digital 
%   signatures, hash functions.
% - User authentication, access control and intrusion detection.
% - Software security: buffer overflow, handling input, interaction between 
%   programs.
% - Operating system security.
% - Malware.
% - Trusted computing, hardware based security and whole disk encryption.
% - Ethical aspects of computer security.
The course covers
applied cryptography used in computer security, e.g.~uses of cryptography for 
code obfuscation or digital rights management;
authentication mechanisms, access control, and intrusion detection;
software security, e.g.~buffer overruns and interaction between programs;
some security mechanisms provided by operating system and hardware;
and malicious software and how these utilise the above weaknesses.
Finally we discuss some ethical implications for computer engineers.

\subsection{Teaching}

The main course literature is \citetitle{Gollmann2011cs} by 
\citeauthor{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
This is complemented by \citetitle{Anderson2008sea} by 
\citeauthor{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
The course is taught using lectures, individual laboratory assignments, 
workshops (\enquote{hackathon labs}), seminars, and finally a written exam.
You can find a more detailed timetable, containing lab sessions etc., in the 
following subsection.
All assignments are numbered consecutively prefixed with an \enquote{L} for 
laboratory assignments, \enquote{H} for hackathons and \enquote{S} for seminar 
assignments.
For general information about the examination of these and deadlines, see 
\cref{Assessment}.
For detailed information, please see the instructions found in the course 
platform.

\subsection{Schedule}
\label{Schedule}

To make your reading of the course easier, you are presented with a suggested 
schedule in this section.
You are free to follow this schedule or any schedule you make for yourself, but 
the deadlines, laboratory sessions, and lectures will follow this schedule.
You will find a short summary of the schedule in \cref{TimeTable}.
The detailed reading instructions for each item in the schedule can be found in 
the following sections.

\section{Assessment}
\label{Assessment}

This section explains how the course modules are graded and mapped to LADOK\@.
\Cref{LADOKTable} visualizes the relations between modules, credits, grades and 
LADOK\@.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{%
    Table summarizing course modules and their mapping to LADOK\@.
    P means pass, F means fail.
    A--E are also passing grades, where A is the best.
  }\label{LADOKTable}
  \begin{tabular}{rrll}
    \toprule
    LADOK & Credits (ECTS)  & Grade       & Course Assignments\\
    \midrule
    I104  & 0.0             & P, F        & L0\\
    L104  & 3.0             & P, F        & L1, L3, L4, H5, H6\\
    S104  & 1.5             & P, F        & S2, S7\\
    T104  & 3.0             & A--F        & Exam\\
    \midrule
    Total & 7.5             & A--F        & (Determined by exam)\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The written exam will be graded A--E for passing grades, F or Fx for failing 
grades.
You will receive an Fx if you are very close to passing.
In this case you may complement your written exam with an oral exam within 
a week from receiving the result.
If you do not take this chance within a week you must retake the exam the next 
time it is given.
The grade of the exam will also be the grade of the course total.

\subsection{Handed-in assignments}

In general, all hand-ins in the course must be in a \enquote{passable} 
condition; i.e.\ they must be well-written, grammatically correct and without 
spelling errors, have citations and references according to~\cite{IEEEcitation} 
(see also~\cite{PurdueCitation} for a tutorial), and finally fulfil all 
requirements from the assignment instruction.
If you hand something in which is not in this condition, you will receive an 
F with the comment \enquote{incomplete}.

All handed-in material must be created by yourself, or, in the case of group 
assignments, created by you or one of the group members.
When you refer to or quote other texts, then you must provide a correct list of 
references and, in the case of quotations, the quoted text must be clearly 
marked as quoted.
If any part of the document is plagiarized you risk being suspended from study  
for a predetermined time, not exceeding six months, due to disciplinary 
offence.
If it is a group assignment, all group members will be held accountable for 
disciplinary offence unless it is clearly marked in the work who is responsible 
for the part containing the plagiarism.

If cooperation takes place without the assignment instruction explicitly 
allowing this, this will be regarded as a disciplinary offence with the risk of 
being suspended for a predetermined time, not exceeding six months.
Unless otherwise stated, all assignments are to be done individually.
