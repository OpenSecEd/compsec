  \subsection{Scope}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item We treat computer security.
      \item \Ie how to secure computer systems.

        \pause

      \item We cover authentication and access control, software security, 
        \etc.

        \pause

      \item This gives a good foundation that can later be expanded with things 
        like network security and information security.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

This course is an introduction to computer security.
The course aims towards a good understanding for the requirements of a secure 
computer system.
Problems such as authentication and access control; software security, such as 
buffer overflows; as well as operating system, library and application security 
mechanisms are treated in the course.

\mode<presentation>{%
  \subsection{Aims}
}

More concretely, the \acp{ILO} of the course are the following.
After completing the course, you should be able to:
\begin{frame}
\mode<presentation>{You should be able to}
\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{apply} different cryptosystems and \emph{explain} how these work,

  \item \emph{analyse} problems of authentication, access control and different 
    solutions,

  \item \emph{explain} how some common attacks on software works,

  \item \emph{analyse} different operating system security mechanisms,

  \item \emph{analyse} the functionality of different types of malware,

  \item \emph{explain} different malware protection mechanisms,

  \item \emph{evaluate} strengths and weaknesses of hardware-based security and 
    full-disk encryption, as well as

  \item \emph{value and argue} about different ethical aspects of computer 
    security.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
The course has a variety of learning sessions designed to ensure that you learn 
these \acp{ILO}.
Each such session has a set of further specified \acp{ILO}:
\eg the first outcome above refers to \enquote{different cryptosystems}, the 
\acp{ILO} of a learning session would specify which cryptosystems it covers.


\section{Course structure and content overview}%
\label{sec:outline}

% - Basic cryptography: block ciphers, asymmetric cryptosystems, digital 
%   signatures, hash functions.
% - User authentication, access control and intrusion detection.
% - Software security: buffer overflow, handling input, interaction between 
%   programs.
% - Operating system security.
% - Malware.
% - Trusted computing, hardware based security and whole disk encryption.
% - Ethical aspects of computer security.

The course covers
applied cryptography used in computer security, \eg uses of cryptography for 
code obfuscation or digital rights management;
authentication mechanisms, access control, and intrusion detection;
software security, \eg buffer overruns and interaction between programs;
some security mechanisms provided by operating system and hardware;
and malicious software and how these utilise weaknesses in the system.
Finally, we discuss some ethical implications for computer engineers.

\subsection{Teaching and tutoring}

\mode<presentation>{%
  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Teaching consists of several types of learning sessions.
      \item Most topics are covered only by lectures.
        
        \pause

      \item Some are complemented with seminars, hand-ins and labs.
      \item These are for combined learning and assessment.
      \item We have hackathon labs.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Assignments are labelled in consecutive order.
      \item Labs are prefixed with \enquote{L}.
      \item Seminars are prefixed with \enquote{S}.
      \item Memos are prefixed with \enquote{M}.
      \item Hackathons are prefixed with \enquote{H}.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
}

The course consists of several types of learning sessions:
lectures, seminars, laboratory work.
All assignments are numbered consecutively prefixed with an \enquote{L} for 
laboratory assignments, \enquote{S} for seminar assignments, \enquote{M} for 
memos and \enquote{H} for hackathons.

\subsection{Schedule}

You will find an outline for a schedule for the course in \cref{Schedule}.
You are free to follow this schedule or any schedule you make for yourself, but 
the learning and tutoring sessions, deadlines \etc will follow this schedule.
The detailed reading instructions for each item in the schedule can be found in 
the following sections.

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]

\end{frame}


\section<article>{Course content}

This section summarizes the material covered by the lectures and assignments, 
\ie what you should read for each of them.
It is divided by topics and ordered according to progression of the course, 
\cref{Schedule} gives an overview along with a schedule.

During this lecture we will shortly review the course and try to fit things into 
a bigger picture.

\subsection{Final exam}

The final exam will assess how well you have achieved the intended learning 
outcomes of the course.
Hence, it covers all the content given above.

Each question on the exam covers one topic of the course.
To pass the exam (and thus the course) you must pass all questions (thus all 
topics), \ie you must not receive zero on any question.

If you receive a zero on one question you qualify for an oral
}


\section{Assessment}%
\label{Assessment}

\mode<presentation>{%
  \subsection{LADOK modules}
}

This section explains how the course modules are graded and mapped to LADOK\@.
\Cref{LADOKTable} visualizes the relations between modules, credits, grades and 
LADOK\@.

\begin{frame}
  \input{ladok.tex}
\end{frame}

The written exam will be graded A--E for passing grades, F or Fx for failing 
grades.
You will receive an Fx if you are very close to passing.
In this case you may complement your written exam with an oral exam.
If you do not take this chance you must retake the exam the next 
time it is given.
The grade of the exam will also be the grade of the course total.
