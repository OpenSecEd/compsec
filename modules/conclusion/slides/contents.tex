%\section{Summary of the course}
%
%\subsection{Foundations}
%
%\paragraph{What is security?}
%
%\emph{Summary:}
%In this learning session we will cover the foundations of security.
%By this we mean what security is all about, \eg what types of properties we are 
%interested in and what we want to achieve in our security work.
%
%\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
%After this session you should be able:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item to \emph{understand} the what security is generally about.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{Reading:}
%You should read Gollmann's chapter on \enquote{Foundations of Computer 
%  Security}~\cite[Chap.\ 3]{Gollmann2011cs}.
%There he attempts at a definition of Computer Security and related terms, \eg 
%confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which we need for our treatment of 
%the topic.
%Anderson also covers this in Chapter 1 of~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
%He also treats a wider area than just \emph{computer} security, which is good 
%for us, he covers many aspects of security in different examples.
%
%\paragraph{The scientific method}
%
%\emph{Summary:}
%In this learning session we will give an introduction to the scientific method 
%and particularly how this can be applied in the area of security.
%
%\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
%After this session you should be able:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item to \emph{differentiate} which types of scientific methods are 
%    appropriate to answer a given question.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{Reading:}
%You should read 
%\citetitle{HowToDesignSecurityExperiments}~\cite{HowToDesignSecurityExperiments}.
%This paper discusses the scientific method of (parts of) the security field.
%For a more in-depth reflection on the state of security as a scientific pursuit, 
%we recommend
%\citetitle{SecurityAsAScience}~\cite{SecurityAsAScience}.
%
%\paragraph{Usability}
%
%One important aspect of security, which traditionally is forgotten, is the 
%users' weaknesses.
%The psychology of the human mind is therefore an important subject to discuss 
%in the context of security.
%And consequently, we must adapt our systems to those limitations.
%How the users function and how to adapt systems to their limitations is at the 
%centre of the usability area.
%
%Anderson gives a short summary of the psychology of users, their strengths and 
%weaknesses, in Chapter 2 ``Usability and Psychology'' in 
%\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
%Also treated here is the ever-recurring problem of password policies.
%The material covering this area is the article 
%\citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa} and its follow-up article 
%\citetitle{Komanduri2014can}~\cite{Komanduri2014can}.
%Base on the abstracts for the modules.
