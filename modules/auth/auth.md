This learning module consists of two learning sessions:

  - \[[slides](http://ver.miun.se/courses/security/dasak/auth-slides.pdf)\]
  - \[[recording](https://connect.sunet.se/p5ka03zd58q/)\]
  - \[[recording](https://connect.sunet.se/p178wpyqg5o/)\]

These will cover authentication in general. Then there is a lab, [Password 
cracking and social engineering][passwd], and a seminar, [Password 
policies][pwdpolicies]. The work done in the lab will inform the discussion in 
the seminar.
