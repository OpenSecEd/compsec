# First session: Course intro

We will start the course with an introduction.
This will happen [in Zoom][zoom-room], see the [schedule][schedule] for the 
date and time.

[Zoom][zoom] is a tool for video conferencing. There are clients for the web 
browser (no installation), the computer (Linux, Mac, Windows) and smartphones 
(Android, iPhone).
Note that it is mandatory to have functioning webcam and headset (anyone with a 
smartphone has this and so does anyone with a laptop).

You can also use this tool for yourselves too to have meetings in working 
groups, practice for presentations etc.: just start the client and create your 
own meeting.

All details covered during this session (and more) can be found in the [study 
guide][studyguide]. Please make sure to read it.


# Second session: What's up with security?

To familiarize yourself with the topic and its importance in society, we will 
start the course with a seminar to discuss the role of security: [What's up 
with security?][security-news] (see the [schedule][schedule] for the date and 
time).

Create or sign up to a group (see Working Groups below).
These groups will be reused throughout the course, whenever group work is 
required.
