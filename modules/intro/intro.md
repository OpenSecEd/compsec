# About the course

We start the course by a short introduction to the course and the topic.
All details about the course can be found in the [study guide][studyguide] --- 
read it!

## Teaching and tutoring

Interactive sessions will use [Zoom][zoom], in particular the [this 
room][zoom-room]. There are clients for the web browser (no installation), the 
computer (Linux, Mac, Windows) and smartphones (Android, iPhone).
Note that it is mandatory to have functioning webcam and microphone (anyone 
with a smartphone has this and so does anyone with a laptop).

You can also use this tool for yourselves too to have meetings in working 
groups, practice for presentations etc.: just start the client and create your 
own meeting.

However, there will be in-classroom sessions too, like labs, seminars and 
presentations.

## Group work

Most of the work in the course will be done in a group. Start by creating or 
signing up to a group (see Working Groups below). These groups will be reused 
throughout the course, whenever group work is required.

## Asynchronous communication

The best way to get questions answered in the course is to post them in the 
course forum. Then any teacher can answer and other students can see that their 
question has already been asked and answered.

## Times and schedule

All scheduled events for this course will be scheduled using the University's 
central scheduling system.  That means all events should be visible to you in 
your [personal schedule in the Student Portal][schedule] and be able to export 
them to the calendar app of your choice.


# The first two sessions

We will have a first introductory session where we go through the course, most 
of what's in the [study guide][studyguide]. This will be a rather short 
session.

The next session is a seminar: [What's up with security?][security-news].
The aim of the seminar is to familiarize yourself with the topic and its 
importance in society. You'll need to do some reading before this session, so 
be sure to read the instruction and prepare. You will prepare in groups, so 
sign up for a group quickly.
