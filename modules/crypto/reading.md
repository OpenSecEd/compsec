The concept of Shannon entropy, the main part of information theory, is
treated in a few short texts:  [@Eckersley2010apo] and
 [@Ueltschi2013se]. You should read on the use of entropy to estimate
identifiability:  [@Eckersley2010hui].

The basics of cryptography is covered by Chapter 5 in Anderson’s 
[@Anderson2008sea] and Chapter 14 in Gollmann’s [@Gollmann2011cs].
For the topics zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation, 
however, we refer to [@EOCS].
