# Overview

There is one interactive session for this module (see the [schedule][schedule] 
for date and time). Before that session, work through the material below: watch 
  the videos linked and read the material (at least skim all of it).

During the session we will summarize (together) the most important parts and 
discuss the most difficult/ambiguous/strange/counter-intuitive parts.
