There is one interactive session for this module (see the [schedule][schedule] 
for date and time). Before that session, work through the material found in
[this][ScalableLearning] module. There are also reading instructions in the 
[study guide][studyguide] (Section 3.2).

During the session we will summarize (together) the most important parts and 
discuss the most difficult/ambiguous/strange/counter-intuitive parts.
